# Microcomputer-Design
Introduction:
-	The goal of this project is to design, build, and program a single-board computer. It also provides insight into computer architecture

Chip Specification:
- XR68C681CJ-F – DUART: the XR68C681 devices offers a single IC solution for the 68000 family of microprocessors.
- U62256ADK07LLG – RAM: Static RAM 32K x 8-Bit High Speed CMOS 150ns DIP -28
- AT28C256-15PU – ROM: Memory & Data Storage (EEPROM IC EEPROM 256k 50NS 28DIP) 
- Max232E: IC Transceiver 2 channel 16DIP to interface with DUART
- LD1085V50 – Voltage Regulator: Step 9V down to 5V to provide power for the entire board
- JS202011SCQN – Power Switch: Switch to turn on & off power
- B3F-1022 – Reset Button: Simple power button to activate RESET on the buttons
-	A-DS 09 A/KG-T2S – D-SUB connector: create serial communications with the desktop
-	PJ-002B – Barrel Plug: Barrel Connector to connect with power adapter
- ECS-2200B-080: Create 8MHz clock signal for the CPLD & CPU
- ECS-2100AX-036: Create 3.6MHz clock signal for the DUART chips
- 22-28-4061: J-TAG connector to program the CPLD
